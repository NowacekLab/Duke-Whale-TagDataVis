# How do you begin?

## If you are a developer...

* Make sure npm and yarn are installed

1. Pull the repository 
2. Run 'npm install' then 'yarn add' inside the appropriate app_proto folder 
3. If not all dependencies were installed, then install any extra using yarn (list available in requirements.txt, though potentially not exhaustive)
4. If you run into errors, then alternate between npm install and yarn add until it works 
5. Run 'yarn dev', hot reloading is enabled by default 

* If you want to package the app...

1. Verify the app works with 'yarn dev' by testing it in a full run
2. Remove any unnecessary files from testing done in step 1
3. Run 'yarn package'
4. Go to 'release' folder 

## If you are a tester...

* Ask a developer to package the application for you and send a dmg version
